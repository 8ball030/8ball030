Low-latency engineer building crypto trading infrastructure and market-making systems.

Rust-first. Obsessed with microseconds, deterministic systems, and clean data pipelines. I design and run high-frequency bots, exchange connectors, and analytics stacks across derivatives venues, with a focus on real PnL, not toy benchmarks.

Working on Derolas: fragmented-market liquidity, agent-based strategies, and data-driven execution at scale.
